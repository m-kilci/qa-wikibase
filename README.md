# QA-Wikibase

## University Project | Question Answering | Wikibase | NLP

A university project to develop a **question-answering system** using **Elasticsearch, FastText, and SpaCy** to retrieve answers from a **Wikibase dataset containing 300,000 Wikipedia articles**.

---

## Description

The goal of this project is to create an efficient **Question-Answering (QA) system** that can retrieve accurate answers from a **large-scale Wikibase JSONL dataset**.  
The system uses **Elasticsearch** for full-text search, **FastText** for semantic similarity, and **SpaCy** for entity recognition and question classification.

The system was developed as part of a **benchmarking competition**, where different teams aimed to achieve the highest accuracy in answering questions.

> **Note:** Due to project constraints, we were **not allowed to use large pre-trained AI models** like **BERT, SBERT, or GPT-based architectures**. Instead, we had to build our system using more lightweight **traditional NLP techniques**.

## Features
✔ Full-text search using **Elasticsearch**  
✔ Semantic similarity analysis using **FastText**  
✔ Named Entity Recognition (NER) with **SpaCy**  
✔ Question classification using **Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)**  
✔ Automatic answer extraction  
✔ Batch evaluation with test datasets

## Getting Started

The link to the Wikibase dataset, which our Professor provided us, is sadly not available anymore.

## Results % Accuracy

- Question classifier accuracy: 67%
- Accuracy on test dataset: 37.14% 
- Overall accuracy: 19.1% (evaluated by our professor)
